- Server
    Server side API.

    - Entity
        Entity manager.

        - Register(prototype)
            Registers a new entity prototype used later for spawning new
            entities. This can only be done during the entity registering phase
            of the server (after, the function is deleted).
            - prototype [table]
                Must at least contain a string value called "entityName"
                (alphanumerical + "-" + "_", size 1-20).

        - RegisterPositional(prototype)
            Registers a new positional entity prototype (see Register()).

        - Spawn([position], entityName, [arg, [cbTarget, cbFunction, [cbArg]]])
            Adds an event for spawning a new entity on the next tick.
            - position [table]
                Position of the new entity (must be used for spawning a
                positional entity and must be omitted for spawning a normal
                entity).
            - entityName [string]
                Type of the new entity.
            - arg [serializable]
                Argument to be given to the Spawn() function of the new entity.
            - cbTarget [number]
            - cbFunction [string]
            - cbArg [serializable]
                Notification callback to be called just after the spawn event
                is handled. The callback will receive the following parameters
                (in addition to self): cbArg [serializable], entityId [number].
                entityId will be set to the newly spawned entity id if the
                creation was successful, or 0 if there was an error. entityId
                will still contain an id if the new entity did not have a
                Spawn() function (that is, arg was not passed to the new
                entity).
                If the callback's target is unloaded or destroyed when the
                callback is triggered, the callback fails silently.

        - SpawnFromPlugin([position], plugin, entityName,
                          [arg, [cbTarget, cbFunction, [cbArg]]])
            Adds an event for spawning a new entity from a different plugin
            (see Spawn()).
            - plugin [string]
                Plugin in which to search for the entity type.

        - Kill(target, [arg, [cbTarget, cbFunction, [cbArg]]])
            Adds an event for killing an entity on the next tick.
            - target [number]
                Id of the entity to kill.
            - arg [serializable]
                Argument to be given to the Die() function of the killed entity.
            - cbTarget [number]
            - cbFunction [string]
            - cbArg [serializable]
                Notification callback to be called just after the kill event is
                handled. The callback will receive the following parameters (in
                addition to self): cbArg [serializable], result [table]. result
                will have the following fields: "entityId" [number], "success"
                [boolean]. The "entityId" field will be set to the id of the
                target entity and the "success" field will be set to true if
                the entity was found (kill successful) or false otherwise.
                The "success" field will still be set to true if the entity did
                not have a Die() function (that is, arg was not passed to the
                killed entity), or even if the Die() function triggered an
                error.
                If the callback's target is unloaded or destroyed when the
                callback is triggered, the callback fails silently.

        - CallLater(seconds, function, [arg])
            Adds an event for calling a function of the calling entity. This
            call is guaranteed to succeed if the function exists.
            - seconds [number]
                Number of seconds to wait before calling the function.
            - function [string]
                Name of the function to call.
            - arg [serializable]
                Argument to pass to the function.

        - Call(function, [arg])
            Calls CallLater() with the first parameter (seconds) set to 0.

    - Message
        Messaging system between entities.

        - Later(seconds, target, function,
                [arg, [cbTarget, cbFunction, [cbArg]]])
            Adds an event for calling an entity function.
            - seconds [number]
                Number of seconds to wait before calling the function.
            - target [number]
            - function [string]
            - arg [serializable]
                Entity function to call.
            - cbTarget [number]
            - cbFunction [string]
            - cbArg [serializable]
                Notification callback to be called just after the call event is
                handled. The callback will receive the following parameters (in
                addition to self): cbArg [serializable], result [table]. result
                will have the following fields: "entityId" [number], "success"
                [boolean]. The "entityId" field will be set to the id of the
                target entity and the "success" field will be set to true if
                the entity was found and the function was successfully called
                or false otherwise.
                If the callback's target is unloaded or destroyed when the
                callback is triggered, the callback fails silently.

        - Now(target, function, [arg, [cbTarget, cbFunction, [cbArg]]])
            Calls Later() with the first parameter (seconds) set to 0.
